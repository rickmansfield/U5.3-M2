# Unit 5.3 M2 Task 2

## Question
- In your own words, explain the strengths of a stack data structure. 

## My answer
- The main strength of a stack is all the operations are fast. i.e. they take O(1) time. They are particularyly useful in any situation where LIFO is the desired order. Example parsing strings. Also function calls and executions contexts are managed in a call stack. So, when you call a function it's added to the stack. When it returns it gest popped off the stack. Lastly a  stack is good to do an iterative depth-first-search.
